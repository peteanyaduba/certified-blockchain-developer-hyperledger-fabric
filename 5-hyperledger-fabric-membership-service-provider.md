# Hyperledger Fabric - Membership Service Provider

1.  Membership Service Provider (MSP) is the pluggable interface which supports variety of credentials architectures.
    -   It supports all the Certificate Authorities (CAs) or CA-servers being used behind the MSP
    -   It is the interface that requests the server because the clients and SDKs can't or don't approach the CA servers directly
